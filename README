[WIP]

Extending my (not my work) the popular Win10 Widgets Rainmeter Theme to have temperature overlays on the 
medium-sized performance widgets.


Requirements for you to use this: 
-Rainmeter: https://www.rainmeter.net/
-Win10 Widgets: http://win10widgets.com/
-Roboto Font Family: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?selection.family=Roboto
-HWiNFO64: https://www.hwinfo.com/download.php
-HWiNFO64 Rainmeter plugin: https://www.hwinfo.com/addons.php
-The willingness to follow this guide to find your system specific sensor information and change those
	values in a master .ini file I will eventually make but for now they're in each template file:

Notes:
-To monitor Drives, you need to use S.M.A.R.T. monitoring, which will make some (mine) HDDs generate an
	annoying clicking sound. I recommend setting your HWiNFO settings->General->Polling Frequency Global
	to 2000ms and Disk S.M.A.R.T. every 30 cycles for disk airflow temperature updates every 1/minute, 
	(which is 1 click/minute).
		
To Do List:
-GPU Usage for GPU0 and GPU1
-GPU Temp for GPU0 and GPU1
-Move all sensor values to variables and make an .ini file to set them all in one place
-Recolor the Network graph colors because now it looks plain
